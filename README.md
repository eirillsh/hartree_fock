# From Hartree-Fock to Møller-Plesset

Project description by UiO FYS4411. 


Hartree-Fock and Møller-Plesset calculation on Helium and Beryllium using an atomic basis consisting of hydrogen orbitals.  


A somewhat rouge harmonic oscillator basis is also included, where the coulomb integrals are numerically integrated using gaussian quadrature.
